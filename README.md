# The Depths

## The Jam
I put this game together for the Simplicity Jam #2 hosted [here](https://itch.io/jam/simplicity-jam-2)

The theme was Light and Shadow and there were a number of optional limitations

Of the optional limitations, I chose to use the "two color palette" rule, with the idea that sticking to black and white would keep some of the design simpler

I knew I wanted a mechanic where the player would have a finite light resource that would limit their ability to explore when exhausted

While the game is completable without being able to see beyond your character, it is definitely difficult without the benefit of knowing where everything is

I opted to use Godot because it's lightweight and I've been writing a lot of Python recently anyways

After this jam, I have a hard time seeing myself use any other engine any time soon
